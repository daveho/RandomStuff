# Random Stuff Episode 6: Breadboard hex displays

Link to video: coming soon

In this episode, we update the design of the 8 and 16 bit (2 and 4 digit)
hex displays seen in previous episodes (mostly in the
[DIY 8-bit computer](https://github.com/daveho/DIY8bit) series.)

The [hexdisplay8](hexdisplay8) and [hexdisplay16](hexdisplay16) directories
have the schematics, PCB layouts (including Gerber files), and parts lists.

The [hexdisplay8\_fw](hexdisplay8_fw) and [hexdisplay\_16](hexdisplay16_fw)
directories have the firmware for each display.
