# Random Stuff Episode 7: Slightly better hex displays

Link to video: coming soon

This is just a quick video with some additional progress on the hex displays
featured in the [Episode 6](../Episode06):

The progress is:

* The brightness of the 4-digit display is improved using lower value
  current-limiting resistors
* [Blue 7-segment displays](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Led-Segment-Display_SUNLIGHT-SLR0361DBA3BD-4-0_C225953.html)
  (click for details) from [lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com/en) are tested

Unfortunately, the blue displays are narrower than the displays the PCBs were
designed for, so we'll need to update the PCB layout to accommodate them.
The good news is that this will further reduce the size of the PCBs.
We'll tackle that in a future episode.
