# Experiments with 8048 family microcontrollers

In this episode, we experiment with 8048 family microcontrollers.

This is a work in progress, right now I'm just collecting information and planning an initial circuit.

## Information resources

* [8048 maze generator](https://hackaday.io/project/19278-8048-maze-generator): good example of a schematic incorporating the 8048, address latch, and external ROM
