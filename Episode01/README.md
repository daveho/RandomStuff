# Episode 1: 8051 family microcontrollers, initial experiments

In this episode I show some basic experiments with the Atmel AT89C2051
microcontroller.  I am planning to use an 8051 family device (the
87C51) as the keyboard controller for my [8 bit computer project](https://github.com/daveho/DIY8bit).

The [hw](hw) directory has the circuits for each experiment.

The [fw](fw) directory has the firmware programs for each experiment.

Piotr Bakalarski's Instructable [Introduction to 8051 Programming With AT89C2051](https://www.instructables.com/id/Introduction-to-8051-Programming-With-AT89C2051-gu/) was incredibly helpful as a guide for getting started, and I shamelessly
stole/adapted his schematics and code for my experiments.  Thanks, Piotr!
