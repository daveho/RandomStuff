In this video we will create the "ultimate" versions of the 8 and 16
bit breadboard hex displays using the blue 7-segment displays from
[lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com/en).  These displays are much brighter than
the [previous ones](../Episode07), and are easily readable even in bright
light.

The [hexdisplay8](hexdisplay8) directory has the schematics and parts
list for the 8 bit version.

The [hexdisplay16](hexdisplay16) directory has the schematics and parts
list for the 16 bit version.

The [hexdisplay8\_fw](hexdisplay8_fw) and [hexdisplay16\_fw](hexdisplay16_fw)
directories have the firmware programs for each display.
