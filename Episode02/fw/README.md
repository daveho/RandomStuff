# Episode 2 firmware code

This directory has the firmware programs shown in Episode 2.  They are as follows:

* [Blink\_LED](Blink_LED): LED blink program, exactly the same as the one from [Episode 1](../../Episode1)
* [InOutAVR](InOutAVR): program to control an LED using a pushbutton switch, AVR version
* [InOut](InOut): program to control an LED using a pushbutton switch, buggy 8051 version
* [InOut2](InOut2): program to control an LED using a pushbutton switch, fixed 8051 version
* [PortStatus](PortStatus): program to repeatedly read from port 3 and output the data value to port 1 (not shown in video, but it helped me understand 8051 I/O)
